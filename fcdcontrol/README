This is a fast hack for a command line interface for funcube dongle, 
so I can use it in scripts and the like.
I decided to publish it because I think it can be useful to some other people.

This copy has been further hacked by Alexandru Csete OZ9AEC to make it work with
the Funcube Dongle Pro+.

FCD HID code is from QTHID so thank them:
