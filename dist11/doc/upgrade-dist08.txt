Upgrade instructions for the WebSDR server (20110606, pa3fwm@amsat.org)
=======================================================================

This upgrade essentially boils down to unpacking the new version
in the right place, stopping the old version, and starting the
new version. See below for more details.

However, if you did not yet upgrade to the -dist07 version which I
distributed in January 2011, then you will need to follow the older
upgrade instructions. Those are included in the present package in
dist08/doc/upgrade-dist07.txt .
If you need any help with this procedure, please contact me.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of the new version:  (or: why should I bother with the upgrade?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Data for the waterfall displays is now compressed, to about a quarter
  of what it used to be. This significantly reduces the internet bandwidth
  usage of the system, so at sites with limited uplink speed, more
  simultaneous users can be supported.

* The feature of viewing only the last 20 lines of the logbook has
  returned; it was accidentally omitted in -dist07.

* The timing control loop in the sound applet has been improved, which
  should cause less speed fluctuations, and thus better decoding of
  some (digital) modes.

* A bug that caused problems with some combinations of bands has been
  fixed.

* There are now buttons for zooming the waterfall in/out, besides the
  existing use of the scroll wheel for this.

* A 64-bit binary is now included in the package, which is useful if you
  run a 64-bit Linux system.

* There is preliminary support for ALSA sound devices, see config.txt.
  This is rather experimental though; reports would be welcome.


---------------------------------
Step-by-step upgrade instructions
---------------------------------

In order to upgrade to the new version, do the following:

1. Go to the /home/websdr directory, or wherever you installed the websdr.
   Just to be sure: this is the directory which has a subdirectory named
   'dist07'.

2. Unpack the new websdr-dist08.tgz file here.
   This creates a subdirectory named 'dist08' containing the new version.
   It will not overwrite anything else.

3. Stop the old websdr version, if you hadn't done so yet.

4. Change into the /home/websdr/dist08 directory, and start the
   program there: ./websdr
   Or ./websdr64 if you have a 64-bit system.

5. If you had made any changes to the files in dist07/pub2 , you'll
   want to make them again in dist08/pub2 .
   Otherwise, the upgrade is complete!

If you have problems with the new version, you can easily go back to the
previous one, by stopping the new one, going to the dist07 directory and
starting websdr there again.
