========================================================================
Upgrade instructions for the WebSDR server (20130312, pa3fwm@websdr.org)
========================================================================

This upgrade essentially boils down to unpacking the new version in the
right place, stopping the old version, and starting the new version.
See below for more details.
Note: the procedure is the same as before, except for step 3.
If you need any help with this procedure, please contact me.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of the new version:  (or: why should I bother with the upgrade?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features for the users:

* FM demodulation.
  (If your WebSDR is on a band where there's no FM, you can remove it by
  deleting the line containing FM from pub2/websdr-controls.html ).

* Memory channels.

* Volume control (using an HTML5 control which looks like a slider on
  browsers which already support it, and a textual input on others).

* Squelch.
  In contrast to many hardware squelches, this one does not react to
  the signal level itself, but to the modulation, and as a consequence,
  does not need a threshold control.

* Automatic notch filter for SSB.

* Frequencies typed in the chatbox are now clickable.

* Labels on the frequency axis (as configured in stationinfo.txt) can
  now also have a mode and are clickable.

* Option to make the display of other listeners compact, so the chatbox
  is closer to the other controls.

Other:

* You can now configure the initial frequency and mode (i.e., where
  listeners find themselves upon going to the page); see doc/config.txt,
  option 'initial').

* You can now configure the administrator controls (sysop.html) to be
  also accessible from other computers in your local network.
  (see doc/config.txt, option 'dotrustlocalnet')
  
* The maximum number of users is now not enforced anymore for users
  logging in from the server itself (and, optionally, machines on
  the local network).

* Removed the separate Java version test applet; this is useful because
  some browsers nowadays ask the user for permission for each Java
  applet, so reducing the number of applets means less user annoyance.

* A simple configurable noiseblanker for strong local noise spikes has
  been added; see doc/config.txt, option 'noiseblanker'.

* Most signal processing is now stopped when there are no listeners; this
  should save some energy.

* The 'view last 20 entries of log' option is re-included, after accidentally
  being omitted in the previous version.

* Support for the RTL-SDRs: cheap USB DVB-T sticks which can be used as
  general-purpose amateur SDRs. However, please use them only in situations
  where their limited dynamic range is really sufficient, e.g., a VHF/UHF
  amateur band with no strong local signals.

* An experimental version for the Raspberry Pi.
  The Raspberry Pi is a cheap and energy efficient little computer, but
  it's not very fast. See doc/raspberrypi.txt for more information.

* There's an experimental feature to invoke an external program to decode
  and report WSPR signals. However, details on how to set this up in a
  handy way still need to be worked out.
  If you're interested in trying this, have a WebSDR which covers one of
  the WSPR frequencies, and are comfortable with Linux, please contact me.

* Support for 116 kHz samplerate (needed for one specific SDR).

* Many minor changes, including bug fixes and browser compatibility issues.

Step-by-step upgrade instructions
---------------------------------

In order to upgrade to the new version, do the following:

1. Go to the /home/websdr directory, or wherever you installed the websdr.
   Just to be sure: this is the directory which has a subdirectory named
   'dist09' containing the previous version.

2. Unpack the new websdr-dist10.tgz file here.
   This creates a subdirectory named 'dist10' containing the new version.
   It will not overwrite anything else.

3. Please include a line like the following in your cfg/websdr.cfg :
     org email youremail@adres.com
   This e-mail address will NOT be shown anywhere, but it will be sent
   to the websdr.org server. I will use this address for distributing
   software updates in the future. 

4. Stop the old websdr version, if you hadn't done so yet.

5. Change into the /home/websdr/dist10 directory, and start the
   program there: ./websdr
   Or ./websdr64 if you have a 64-bit system.

6. If you had made any changes to the files in dist09/pub2 , you may
   want to make them again in dist10/pub2 .
   Otherwise, the upgrade is complete!

If you have problems with the new version, you can easily go back to the
previous one, by stopping the new one, going to the dist09 directory and
starting websdr there again.
