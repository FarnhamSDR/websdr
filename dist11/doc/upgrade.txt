========================================================================
Upgrade instructions for the WebSDR server (20140709, pa3fwm@websdr.org)
========================================================================

This upgrade essentially boils down to unpacking the new version in the
right place, stopping the old version, and starting the new version.
See below for more details.
Note: the procedure is the same as before, except for step 3.
If you need any help with this procedure, please contact me.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of the new version:  (or: why should I bother with the upgrade?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

New features for the users:

* Support for HTML5 audio as an alternative to the use of Java applets.
  This works on recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari, but
  not on IE.

* Support for use on mobile devices running Android (using Firefox) and
  iOS (using Safari). There's a separate version of the web page for
  mobile use, optimized for their small screens, touch control, and limited
  processing power.

* Recording and then downloading the received audio (only HTML5 and not on
  Safari).

* Making a real-time graph of received signal strength.

* Controlling the receiver web page via the keyboard.


New things for you as the administrator:

* It's possible to enable larger bandwidth ("HiFi") audio for SSB and AM,
  up to about 7 instead of 4 kHz; however, it has some disadvantages, so
  please only enable this if really useful on your site. See "allowwide"
  in config.txt.

* Some limits related to the use of RTL-SDRs have been lifted. You can now
  use converters. However, this doesn't change the fact that these SDRs
  have a limited dynamic range, so don't use them unless you've verified
  that in your system they are not overloaded, e.g., by comparing reception
  to a normal good analog receiver on the same antenna.

* It is now possible to write a driver to attach other SDR hardware to the
  WebSDR software, similar to how the rtl_tcp driver works but with 16 bits
  per sample.
  However, this is untested. If you are serious about writing such a driver,
  please contact me.

* I've made some changes to the reporting to the websdr.org server; this
  should hopefully prevent the problems that in the past caused servers to
  drop from the list.

* You can now explicitly specify which IP addresses have sysop access; see
  "dotrust" in config.txt.

* If your soundcard's gain is not flat across the audio spectrum, you can
  now compensate for this; see "equalize" in config.txt.

* Many minor changes, including bug fixes and browser compatibility issues.


---------------------------------
Step-by-step upgrade instructions
---------------------------------

In order to upgrade to the new version, do the following:

1. Go to the /home/websdr directory, or wherever you installed the websdr.
   Just to be sure: this is the directory which has a subdirectory named
   'dist10a' containing the previous version.

2. Unpack the new websdr-dist11.tgz file here.
   This creates a subdirectory named 'dist11' containing the new version.
   It will not overwrite anything else.

3. If you want to support mobile devices, copy the file 'm.html' from the
   /home/websdr/dist11/pub2/ directory to /home/websdr/pub/ . You may
   want to edit this file later to change the text on the mobile site.

4. Stop the old websdr version, if you hadn't done so yet.

5. Change into the /home/websdr/dist11 directory, and start the
   program there: ./websdr
   Or ./websdr64 if you have a 64-bit system, or ./websdr-rpi if you're
   on a RaspberryPi.

6. If you had made any changes to the files in dist10a/pub2 , you may
   want to make them again in dist11/pub2 .
   Otherwise, the upgrade is complete!

If you have problems with the new version, you can easily go back to the
previous one, by stopping the new one, going to the dist10a directory and
starting websdr there again. Please report the problem to me.
