Installation instructions for the WebSDR server (20140717, pa3fwm@amsat.org)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Preferably, create a new user account for the WebSDR. This is not
   technically necessary, but preferable from a security point of view:
   it limits the damage in case the WebSDR server software would turn out
   to have a security bug.

2. Make sure the newly created websdr account has permission to access
   the soundcard; this is typically done by adding the user to the
   'audio' group:
     adduser websdr audio

3. In that account's homedirectory, unpack the websdr-dist10a.tgz file.
   In the sequel, I will assume that this homedirectory is /home/websdr .
   Unpacking this file creates the complete directory structure needed for
   the WebSDR:

   /home/websdr/pub       - public files (site-specific).
   /home/websdr/cfg       - contains site-specific configuration files.
   /home/websdr/dist11    - non site-specific files for this version.
   /home/websdr/dist11/doc   - contains documentation.
   /home/websdr/dist11/log   - contains detailed log files.
   /home/websdr/dist11/pub2  - another set of public files, non site-specific.
   /home/websdr/dist11/pub2/tmp    - temporary public files.

4. Copy the file /home/websdr/dist11/websdr.cfg to /home/websdr/cfg
   and then use your favorite text editor to edit it (the copy in cfg,
   not the original in dist11 !).
   Documentation for this is provided in the file itself, in the form
   of comment lines (lines starting with #).

5. Copy the file /home/websdr/dist11/pub2/index.html to /home/websdr/pub
   and again use your favorite text editor to edit it (the copy in pub,
   not the original in pub2!).
   The file as supplied works, but you may want to at least customise the 
   textual information it contains; the two relevant places in the file
   are marked as TODO, so you can quickly find them with a text editor.
   Later on, when everything works fine, you can customize this file
   further to make the page look the way you want it to, add more
   information pages, etc.

6. If you want to support mobile devices, copy the file
   /home/websdr/dist11/pub2/m.html to /home/websdr/pub
   and use your favorite text editor to edit it, if needed.
   (Don't put lots of pictures in here though: this file is to be viewed
   on small screens!)

7. Go to /home/websdr/dist11 and start the websdr by typing ./websdr
   (or ./websdr64 if you're using a 64-bit Linux system, or ./websdr-rpi
   on a Raspberry Pi).
   If all is well, the server should now be running!

Some further notes:

* If you want to run the server on port 80, so that the port number can
  be omitted from the URL (i.e., you get http://websdr.example.org/
  instead of something like http://websdr.example.org:8901/ ), you need
  to make the server binary setuid root.
  That can be done by going to /home/websdr/dist11 and typing:
     sudo chown root websdr
     sudo chmod 4510 websdr
  The websdr server is written such that it only uses the root privileges
  to open the TCP socket and drops them at all other times, to minimize
  security risks.

* The server needs several libraries. Most of them will be installed by
  default by your Linux distribution, but two of them may not be, namely:
    libfftw3f (i.e., version 3 of the FFTW library, compiled for float)
  and 
    libpng12  (i.e., version 1.2 of the PNG library).
  Usually they will be available through your distribution's package
  management system. In the case of Debian and Ubuntu, you can install
  them using the following command (as root):
    apt-get install libfftw3-3 libpng12-0

* See the files in /home/websdr/dist11/doc/ for more information;
  in particular, config.txt explains the format of the config file.


A final remark: this software is copyrighted material.
You do get it free of charge, but may only use it for its intended purpose,
namely running a publicly accessible WebSDR site. Any other use, such as
further distribution, reverse engineering, and/or reusing (parts of) the code
in other software, is not allowed without my explicit prior permission.
