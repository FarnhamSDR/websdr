=======================================================================
Upgrade instructions for the WebSDR server (20120428, pa3fwm@amsat.org)
=======================================================================

This upgrade essentially boils down to unpacking the new version in the
right place, stopping the old version, and starting the new version.
See below for more details.
Note: the procedure is the same as before, except that step 5 is new
(and one-time only).

However, if you are still running a pre-dist07 version (pre January 2011),
then you will need to follow the older upgrade instructions. Those are
included in the present package in dist09/doc/upgrade-dist07.txt .
If you need any help with this procedure, please contact me.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of the new version:  (or: why should I bother with the upgrade?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Audio data is now compressed more than before. The compression level
  can be configured (see 'audioformat' in config.txt), but the default
  gives better audio quality than before, at about 30% lower datarate.
  A single WebSDR user, with a single waterfall scrolling at 'slow' speed,
  could now fit in about 80 kbit/s if you turn up the compression further.

* Tuning by scrollwheel now possible, when the mousecursor is on the
  frequency scale.

* It's now possible to put labels on the frequency axis for interesting
  stations, e.g. for beacons. See documentation at the end of
  dist09/doc/config.txt .

* Some technical improvements and bugfixes:
  - better compatibility with different web browsers.
  - "stripy waterfall bug" fixed.
  - fix for Java security exceptions that some users saw.

* Possibility to configure extra deep zooming, at the cost of scroll
  speed (see 'extrazoom' in config.txt).

* Support for some weird sample rates of the bt878 card.



---------------------------------
Step-by-step upgrade instructions
---------------------------------

In order to upgrade to the new version, do the following:

1. Go to the /home/websdr directory, or wherever you installed the websdr.
   Just to be sure: this is the directory which has a subdirectory named
   'dist08'.

2. Unpack the new websdr-dist09.tgz file here.
   This creates a subdirectory named 'dist09' containing the new version.
   It will not overwrite anything else.

3. Stop the old websdr version, if you hadn't done so yet.

4. Change into the /home/websdr/dist09 directory, and start the
   program there: ./websdr
   Or ./websdr64 if you have a 64-bit system.

5. Go to the pub directory and edit the first line of the index.html file.
   In previous versions, it was:
     <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
   This was technically correct, but some browser/OS combinations
   (at least FireFox on MacOS) didn't like it. All browsers seem to
   like the new and much shorter HTML5 version:
     <!DOCTYPE HTML>

6. If you had made any changes to the files in dist08/pub2 , you'll
   want to make them again in dist09/pub2 .
   Otherwise, the upgrade is complete!

If you have problems with the new version, you can easily go back to the
previous one, by stopping the new one, going to the dist08 directory and
starting websdr there again.
