Correcting the I/Q balance in the WebSDR          PA3FWM, 2010-03-15
====================================================================
(updated 2011-01-02)

Analogue SDRs typically do not have perfect I/Q balance: the two
channels (called I and Q, or left and right soundcard input) may not
have exactly the same gain or phase shift.
This results in mirror images of signals.
They can be suppressed to some extent in software. Currently, this
procedure is not automatic in the WebSDR, but only semi-automatic.

1) Connect a signal generator to the SDR's antenna input; set the
   generator to produce an unmodulated carrier within the SDR's
   passband, and set its level such that the signal is very strong
   (so the mirror signals appear), but not so strong that the
   system clips. (Clipping can be seen as the appearance of even
   more signals in the waterfall display.)
   Set the frequency close to the lower limit of the passband,
   but still inside the band.

2) Use a web browser or the 'wget' program to fetch the following
   URL:
     http://your.websdr.hostname.here/~~iqbalance0
   where the last digit should be 0 for the first band, 1 for the
   second band, etc.

3) While the data is coming in, slowly increase the generator's
   frequency, until you are just below the upper limit of the band.
     
4) Stop the fetching of the data.
   Save the file in the websdr's /cfg directory under a suitable name.
   (e.g., /home/websdr/cfg/iq-80m.txt ).
   If needed, clean up the data (see below).

5) In your websdr.cfg, add a line to the appropriate band section
   like
      balance filename.dat
   where filename.dat obviously is the name under which you saved
   the data.

6) Restart the websdr, e.g. via sysop.html .

That weird URL called ~~iqbalance produces at regular intervals one
line of text which contains the I/Q correction data for the frequency
which at that moment contains the strongest signal (which should be
the signal from your signal generator).
The first column represents the frequency, the next two columns are
the correction coefficients, the next one the amplitude of the
test signal, and the last one an auxiliary quantity that is no
longer relevant. Only the first three columns are used.
The file should be in order of increasing frequency; if needed,
sort it (e.g. using 'sort -n').
Watch out that you don't include any data points recorded when the
signal generator was just outside the band: due to the non-perfect
anti-alias filters in the soundcard, such signals can be received,
but would give very wrong I/Q corrections.
