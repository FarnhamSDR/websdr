# first, a few generalities about the server:

# The maximum number of users.
maxusers 10

# On which port should the server listen?
tcpport 80

# If (and only if) you are running the WebSDR on a computer that is shared
# with users that you do not trust, uncomment the following line.
# It disables the system administration interface in sysop.html.
#donttrustlocalhost

# If you do NOT want your WebSDR to register itself on http://www.websdr.org
# site, uncomment the following line:
noorgserver

# The following lines contain information that is transmitted to websdr.org:

# What is your system's (public) hostname?
# (Note: give _only_ the hostname here, _not_ the complete URL; so leave out
# the 'http://' and the portnumber.)
# If left commented out, the www.websdr.org page will show the IP address.
#hostname websdr.suws.org.uk

# Your system's locator square:
org qth IO91KH

# A short description of your site:
org description SUWS Microwave WebSDR

# If you want your logo to appear on the http://www.websdr.org site, do the following:
# - make a 48x48 (non-animated, please!) picture in a usual format, such as GIF, PNG or JPEG;
# - put it in the pub directory of your websdr server;
# - uncomment the following line and put your picture's filename in it:
#org logo mylogo.gif

# We need to configure at least one band:

# First give it a short name, e.g. "20m":
band 2m

# From what sound device should the I/Q audio signals be read;
# typically either /dev/dsp or /dev/dsp0 is your system's primary sound card.
# If your system does not have OSS but does have ALSA, enter the ALSA device
# name here, preceeded by a dollar sign.
#
# OSS example:
#device /dev/dsp
# ALSA example:
device $hw:1,0,0

# Samplerate in Hz:
samplerate 192000

# Center frequency in kHz:
centerfreq 144300

# A short description of the antenna, for listing on websdr.org:
antenna Collinear

# If needed, you can amplify or attenuate the signals by a number of dB:
#gain 20
#gain -10
# If you have a calibrated signal source, you can use this to calibrate the
# S-meter in dBm.


############################################################################
#
# That's all, unless you want to configure more bands. In that case, just repeat
# the band section (starting at the 'band' keyword) from the above.
#
# Several more things can be configured; see config.txt for details.
